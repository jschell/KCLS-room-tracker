## Booking Lead Times
*How far in advance meeting rooms are reserved, inferred from first-seen date.*

> **Methodology:** `lead_days = booking_date − first_seen_date`. For bookings caught fresh (source=`grid_inferred`), first_seen ≈ creation date (accurate to ~12 hours). For the initial batch (source=`grid`), first_seen is a lower bound — true lead times may be longer.
